# Project-C-AR

## Problem + Project 
This quarter, our team chose Project C - (name of project) which focused on enhancing spatial data accuracy of mapped locations. Our main objective was to address issues relation to location correctness - specifically where we resolve spatial stacking, misplacement, and lack of contextual alignment based on the location address, metadata, category, and descriptive tags. Our project aims to reposition POIs and unstack locations to more accurately reflect the real-world spacial layout. 

## OKRs 
OKR #1: 
Objective: 
Enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of map locations by identifying and improving incorrectly stacked or misrepresented points.

Key Results: 
* Identify and analyze stacked locations with >75% extraction accuracy from the total available dataset.
* Develop and evaluate a method to unstack or refine overlapping map locations, achieving at least 85% improvement in location separation precision.
* Implement a feedback mechanism from downstream systems/users to validate improved locations and achieve at least 80% positive accuracy feedback on refined locations.

OKR #2: 
Create an easy-to-use system that can find and fix wrong or confusing map locations (especially in oceans) using extra information.

Key Results: 
* Use extra details like place type, how busy the area is, or time of day to make location fixes more accurate (at least 70% correct and 80% complete).
* Check 5+ features like the environment around the location for additional contextual information.
* Leverage contextual data (e.g., address, metadata, user behavior) to refine 50% of stacked location clusters into more accurate distinct points.
